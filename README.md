## How to use Google Docs maintainer? 

First, you need to create some Google Docs file. By default, there are some of my notebooks' IDs. Just for testing purpose. 
When you create some, you have to extract its ID. 
![How to find ID](https://github.com/tomas-dostal/google_docs_maintainer/blob/master/how_to_get_google_docs_id.png)

Then you need to add this document's ID to proper script. In case you want to use automatic update, open and edit [automatic_maintain.py](https://github.com/tomas-dostal/google_docs_maintainer/blob/master/auto_v1.1/automatic_maintain.py), otherwise open and edit [manual_maintain.py](https://github.com/tomas-dostal/google_docs_maintainer/blob/master/manual_v1.1/manual_maintain.py).

Find where is an array with IDs and add your one. 
```
ids = { â€ž1J_YafGKPBItGqJjxPBgJ-1sWDF2tmwIT0v2wClt2IB8", "Add e.g. here the Google Docs ID", "1BycZMbz8WCVArgHij1m02FmVt2iGv2KdJPtwglpyIXQ"}
```

And here we go. Try to run the .py script just to see if everything goes well. You'll be asked to log into your Google account. 
Later the code checks if your local version of your Google Docs is outdated (there is a newer version). If so, it starts a thread which downloads a PDF of your Google Docs.

The PDF file is saved in the same directory as the script. You can make a software link to another location using following command (*nix only).
```sh
$ ln -s /path/to/script/YOURFILE.PDF /your/desired/path/YOURFILE.PDF
$ ls -l
```
> Filename of a downloaded file is the same as the name of your Google Docs document. 

> You should generate your own settings.yaml file (which is included only for testing purposes at the moment) for your use. You san do it
